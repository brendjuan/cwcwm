## About CwC

CwC is an extensible Wayland compositor with dynamic window management based on wlroots.
Highly influenced by [awesome window manager](https://awesomewm.org), CwC uses Lua for its
configuration and C plugins for extensions.

For new users, you may want to check out the [getting started][getting_started] page.

## Stability state

Crashes may happen so daily driving isn't recommended unless you're okay with them.
If you encounter any crashes, please report them by [creating an issue][github-issue] with steps to
reproduce. I will fix it as quickly as possible because I also daily drive it and
I want my setup to be super stable.

API breaking change is documented with exclamation mark (`!`) in the commit
message as per [conventional commits specification][conventional-commits].
APIs that derived from AwesomeWM are unlikely to get a change therefore
guaranteed not to break your configuration.

- Can be used as floating/tiling window manager.
